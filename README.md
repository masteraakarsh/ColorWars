## üéØ Game Overview

ColorWars is an engaging strategy game where two players compete to control the board through explosive chain reactions. Place dots strategically to trigger massive chain reactions that convert opponent cells to your color!

### üé≤ Core Mechanics

- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players alternate placing dots on the board
- **Strategic Placement**: Place dots only on empty cells or your own cells
- **Critical Mass**: Each cell has a maximum dot capacity based on its position
- **Chain Reactions**: Exploding cells trigger cascading reactions across the board
- **Total Domination**: Win by eliminating all opponent dots from the board

### üí• Explosion Rules

| Cell Position | Max Dots | Adjacent Cells |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Corner        | 2        | 2 neighbors    |
| Edge          | 3        | 3 neighbors    |
| Center        | 4        | 4 neighbors    |

When a cell reaches its maximum capacity, it explodes:
- Sends 1 dot to each adjacent cell
- Converts adjacent opponent cells to your color
- Can trigger chain reactions in neighboring cells

## üé≤ How to Play

### Basic Rules

1. **Choose Your Color**: Red goes first, followed by Blue
2. **Place Dots**: Click on empty cells or your own cells to add dots
3. **Trigger Explosions**: When a cell reaches its maximum capacity, it explodes
4. **Chain Reactions**: Explosions can trigger more explosions
5. **Dominate**: Win by eliminating all opponent dots

### Strategy Tips

- **Corner Control**: Corner cells explode with only 2 dots
- **Edge Advantage**: Edge cells are easier to trigger than center cells
- **Chain Planning**: Look for opportunities to create massive chain reactions
- **Defensive Play**: Sometimes it's better to build up your own cells
- **Timing**: The right move at the right time can flip the entire board

### Advanced Tactics

- **Sacrifice Plays**: Sometimes losing cells can set up bigger gains
- **Zone Control**: Dominate sections of the board systematically
- **Patience**: Don't rush - wait for the perfect chain reaction opportunity
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn common explosion patterns
